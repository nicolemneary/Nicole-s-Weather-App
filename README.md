## Summary
 - This assignment taught me the extensive data storage capacity of APIs and their ability to transform simple webpages into complex ones. The project, starting with just a search bar and text area for city input, evolved significantly through JavaScript. It combined weather information and dates, underscoring the importance of accessing and displaying the right data from the API. The main lesson was learning to effectively retrieve and present this stored data on the webpage.

## Challenges
- This assignment was highly beneficial for me as it posed a significant challenge, enhancing my skills in reading documentation. Initially, I struggled to compose the correct URL for accessing the API, receiving an "app key not found" error due to a missing 'appid=' in the URL. This issue, resolved through careful documentation review, highlighted the importance of accurate URL composition for API access. Moreover, the assignment reinforced the value of using local storage for data retention, an essential practice for developing functional webpages. Overall, the difficulty of the task substantially contributed to my growth in coding proficiency.
